INTRODUCTION                             *translate*

Sometimes I just don't know the german word for an english one that's
in my mind right now, like "translation". In that case, I can just type
:Tr translation to look it up directly in vim. The plugin then fetches
a list of possible translations and lets me choose one to insert it
directly.

COMMANDS                                 *translate-commands*

Right now, only one command is supplied.

`:Tr[anslate][!] {word}`                   *:Translate*
  Searches for translations of {word} for the language pair given by
  |g:translate_src| and |g:translate_dst|. If the [!] is given, the
  languages are switched.

CONFIGURATION                            *translate-config* *translate-cfg*

The default languages for are set to English and German, since I always
now the english word but never the german one. If you want to set
your own, you can edit them by overwriting the following variables.
Please keep in mind, it needs to be present at dict.cc, since it's the
dictionary of my choice.

Currently supported languages are BG, BS, CS, DA, DE, EL, EN, EO, ES,
FI, FR, HR, HU, IS, IT, LA, NL, NO, PL, PT, RO, RU, SK, SQ, SR, SV, TR.

Since this is a mostly german dictionary website, one of the language pairs
has to be DE or EN.

*g:translate_src* [Default: "de"]
  Source language

*g:translate_dst* [Default: "en"]
  Target language
